# Fract-ol
 - Itâ€™s time for you to create a basic computer graphics project!
You are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was
developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images
and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
This will be the opportunity for you to get familiar with the MiniLibX, to discover
or use the mathematical notion of complex numbers, to take a peek at the concept of
optimization in computer graphics and practice event handling

 - This project is about creating a small fractal
exploration program. First, you have to know what
a fractal is
