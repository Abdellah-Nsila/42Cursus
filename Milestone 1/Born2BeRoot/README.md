# What is virtualization ?
Virtualization is a technology that allows you to create a virtual version of a computer system within a single physical machine. This virtual system, called a "virtual machine" (VM), acts like a separate computer with its own operating system, applications, and resources, even though it shares the physical resources (like CPU, memory, and storage) of the host machine.

## What is virtual machine (VMs)?
These are isolated environments on the host system. Each VM has its own OS and runs independently,

## What is Hypervisor ?
A key component in virtualization, a hypervisor is the software layer that enables multiple VMs to run on a single physical host. The hypervisor manages the resources each VM uses, like CPU, memory, and storage. Examples of hypervisors include VirtualBox, VMware, and Hyper-V.

### Why Virtualization?
    Cost-effective: Allows multiple virtual servers to run on a single physical server, saving on hardware costs.
    Flexibility: You can easily create, delete, or modify VMs, which is great for testing and development.
    Isolation: Different environments can run on the same hardware without interfering with each other.
    Scalability: Resources can be dynamically allocated to VMs as needed.
